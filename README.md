## Namecoin ℕ
Namecoin's typographic symbol (often used to identify the currency) is the mathematical symbol for [natural numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number#Notation), `ℕ`.

| Encoding                  |             |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| Unicode Code Point        | `U+2115`    |
| HTML Entity (Decimal)     | `&#8469;`   |
| HTML Entity (Hexadecimal) | `&#x2115;`  |
| URL Escape Code           | `%E2%84%95` |
| CSS                       | `\002115`   |

The typographic name is "double-struck capital n".  You can find fonts that support the symbol [here](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2115/fontsupport.htm) and information on how to input unicode symbols on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_input).

Usage
=====

Only these logos should be used as a currency identifier and for branding software.  Competing and modified logos weaken Namecoin's brand-recognition.  For further guidance, see Firefox's excellent [branding guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/identity/firefox/branding/).

We strongly encourage outsider art and wish to promote liberal expression of the Namecoin brand.  However, this should be restricted to artistic expressions that are part of a larger composition: one-off pieces for fundraisers, images accompanying articles about Namecoin, etc.

## License
We have recently suffered from fraudulent software and misinformation spread by cranks and trolls. We intend to release the files under a permissive copyleft license after we have worked out the trademark and copyright issues with a lawyer.  **The vast majority of use-cases are covered by fair-use** and licensing should not be a problem in the interim.  Basically, if you are not a crank or a troll, feel free to use these graphics.  You are not allowed to impersonate the Namecoin development team or use the Namecoin logo to advertise for other digital currencies.
